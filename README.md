# Ranking_FII
This code is based on my game plan:

# GAME PLAN:
- FII´s with P/VPA between 0.8% and 1%,
- Have liquidity bigger then 10000 per day,
- Found rentable yields//around 1% per month(mean),
- Found FII´s with variable assets//safety.

If you have another strategy, change the GAME PLAN. For change that, just go in function filter_per_sector
and change the parameters in filter_

*For this code I use the Firefox at the function webscrapping, you can change from Chrome(or another).
